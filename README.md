DUCK uses config from `.drip` env file located either at `$HOME/.drip` or local directory. The first time you run, this environment file will be set. Sensitive information like keys and secrets can be stored here.
[TODO: Accept ENV variables from command](https://github.com/DripVerse/duck/issues/3)

If you have used any other DripVerse CLI tools, this config should already exist and no further config will be needed.
